          <footer class="blockquote-footer cite">Vince Beekel from  <cite title="Source Title cite">Clutch Digital Development</cite></footer>
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Have you ever tried to create a website for your business or organization?  It can be a complicated and overwhelming process.  There are many factors to consider when you are deciding which development team or website provider to go with.  You want a professional website at a fair and affordable price that will help promote your business, but is that enough?  Your website should be your number one tool to connect and inform your clients and users about who you are and what you do.  There is a cost-benefit analysis to consider when deciding who is going to build your website and this article is going to cover every aspect to consider when you are creating your website?</p>
            
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">There are many deciding factors when designing and developing a website.  Having a professional looking website is a very important feature but it is not everything.  Your website could have amazing high-resolution images and fun animations but if it is not functional or aggravates your users then your website is not working for you.  Optimizing your website for user functionality is just as important as having a nice web design.  No matter how appealing your website is, if you users don’t have the functionality to interact with your website then you have lost there interest and potentially their business.  If your website isn’t mobile friendly, then you are going to substantially decrease the traffic to your website.  Another thing to consider when building a website is did the developers design your website for digital marketing and search engine optimization.  Even if your website has great visual appeal and functionality, it doesn’t matter if you can’t attract traffic to your site.  </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Price</h6>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">The first factor people think about when building my website is price.  Price is a huge component when it comes to business.  Being price conscience helps business remain profitable and successful.  Although price maybe the deciding factor when choosing who will build your website, it shouldn’t be.  The fact of the matter is you tend to get what you pay for.  </p>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">There are companies that offer low-priced websites.  The reason most companies can afford to give you those cheap websites is because they have pre-packaged templates that lets you choose what design you want.  The only problem with that is that it is not unique.  Odds are that someone else has the same website design but has their logo on it.  From a marketing stand point you want to differentiate yourself from the competition and choosing a template that others have used won’t make your website unique and specific to you and your brand.  Building a custom website from the ground up is the only way to differentiate your website from the competition. </p>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Creating a custom website may sound expensive but it is not.  Granted some companies charge an outrageous amount for them to build you a custom website but it is important that you find the right company that will build you a professional website at the price you deserve.  That is why Clutch Digital Development works with you and your budget to develop you a high-quality customized website to help you and your company stand out from your competitors.  Our team has the experience to develop your dream website to your exact specifications and needs. </p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Functionality</h6>
          
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">It doesn’t matter how amazing your website looks, if it doesn’t have excellent user functionality then your website is hurting your organization.  You want to give the user the best experience possible, helping them not only engage with your website, but your brand as well.  Your website is a direct reflection of your company and if someone can’t easily access features from your website than they won’t interact with your company.  Essentially the website is a window into your business and if clients can’t get value or get frustrated from your website then you have lost their business.</p>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Functionality is a discipline that ensures your users receive an outstanding experience when using your website.  This means that all buttons, tabs, videos, and forms are working properly.  If the basic components of your website are not working than they will see that as a reflection for your product or service.  You also will need to layout your website so that the user can easily navigate throughout your website with ease.  Every page should make it easy for the user to find the information they are looking for without having to go through multiple links to find what they need.  Clutch Digital Development rigorously inspects every page on your website to maximize user experience and engagement to bring as much value to the user as possible.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Mobile and Browser Optimization</h6>
          
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">We all have our own mobile device and browser preferences.  Whether we choose to use Android over iPhone or Mac over a PC, we to get entrenched with those operating systems.  When you are developing a website, you want to make sure that all mobile and browser platforms are accounted for.  You want to make sure that your website can function on all platforms.  You do not want to lose a potential client because your website is limited to a few technological devices.</p>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Not all functions and features work on all mobile devices or browsers.  Considering that everyone has their own preference, you want to make sure that everyone is included when it comes to building you site.  For instance, if someone has an appointment base business, you don’t want a certain group of users to be excluded because your reservation app doesn’t work on their platform.  Our company makes sure that every website and application works on every platform.  Doesn’t matter if you have an iPhone 4 or the new Galaxy Android Phone, it will be optimized for all your customers.  </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Digital Marketing / Search Engine Optimization</h6>
          
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Digital Marketing is one of the most overlooked components when creating website.  Most people think that digital marketing is something that you do after the website is finished.  Yes, digital marketing can be done after the fact, but odds are most development companies do not think about the digital marketing aspect when building you your site.  Digital marketing is the perpetual discipline that helps bring people to your site and that starts from building from the ground up.  </p>

          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">There is nothing worse the investing a lot of time and money into your website just to find out it needs a complete overhaul to become effective in terms of bringing people to your site.  The best way for companies to drive traffic to their site is through organic search engine optimization techniques.  This is done through how the website is outlined and content generation.  If your website isn’t built in accordance with various search engines algorithms like Google, then that will hurt your rankings.  Most people do not go past the first page of their search inquiry so if you are not getting high rankings than that can negatively affect.  If your titles, heading, and paragraphs aren’t optimized for keywords and search terms then your website built for marketing efficiency.  Clutch Digital Development specializes in web development and digital marketing.  This allows us to build your website with a marketing first mentality so that your website is already working for you and your organization as soon as it is launched.  </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Things to Consider</h6>
          
          <p class="blog-body blog-paragraph">Building a website is a very ambiguous process and we want to inform you on all the things to consider when building your company’s website.  Anyone can go out and get a website, but you want that website to be able to be a tangible asset, something that is going to drive your company forward.  Before you start your journey of developing your web presence, make sure you take every factor into account.  Make sure that your website has a professional design and has consistent functionality.  You want your users to be able to navigate freely throughout your site without any headaches.  You want to make sure that your website is working on all platforms, so you are not missing out on any future customers.  Be conscience of how you build your website.  Make sure that you have the marketing techniques in place, so you don’t have to spend time or money fixing your website to optimize your digital marketing efforts.  When you are confident that you are getting the essential features for your website then think about price.  You do not want to go cheap and get a website that isn’t driving your business forward, and you do not want to overpay for your website either.  At the end of the day you tend to get what you pay for and having a website that helps automate your marketing and business is well worth the investment.  </p>
